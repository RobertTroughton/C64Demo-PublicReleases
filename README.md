# C64Demo - Public Demo Releases

The Dive (Genesis*Project), https://csdb.dk/release/?id=179128
--------

To build and run it:-

1) you'll need to open up TheDive\VisualStudioProject\TheDive.sln (Windows only! Sorry, Krill et al!)
2) build and run that. It will output several intermediate files to the "Intermediate" folder
3) run Build/BuildAll.bat. This will generate the disk files (one per demo part - these output into their Build/Parts folders), along with TheDive.d64 in the root.
